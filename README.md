üëã Hi there! I'm a passionate front-end developer and 3D animation enthusiast with a unique journey into coding.

I graduated from the University of Ilorin (Unilorin) with a BSc in Mass Communication, but over time, I discovered my love for coding, which led me down a different path than what I initially studied. People often ask why I'm so interested in coding, and the truth is, I find joy in the logic behind it and the ability to create beautiful, interactive experiences.

 üå±**Skills & Experience**:

- **Front-End Development**:With several years of experience in front-end development, I specialize in building responsive, user-friendly web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React.
- **Certified Front-End Engineer:** I interned at **Tech Crush**, an international tech training organization, where I completed their rigorous training program and earned certification as a **Front-End Engineer**. This experience further solidified my passion for coding and provided me with hands-on experience in modern front-end technologies.
- **3D Animation**:Over 5 years of experience in 3D animation, where I bring designs and concepts to life using tools like Blender and Maya.
- **Media & Broadcasting:** During my internship at **Osun State Broadcasting Corporation (OSBC)**, I had the opportunity to anchor several television programs, including news and entertainment shows, where I served as a **team lead**. I also gained hands-on experience in producing and directing various programs, which allowed me to sharpen my leadership and creative skills in a media production environment.

‚öôÔ∏è**Technologies I Use:**
- **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue.js
- **3D Animation:** Blender, Maya, Cinema 4D
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

üåç **Hobbies**:
- **Swimming:** A great way to relax and stay fit.
- **Travelling:** I love exploring new places and experiencing different cultures.
